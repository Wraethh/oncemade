## üìù Description

Oncemade is the result of 4-days long hackathon during which my awesome group and I had to come up with a hybrid of two objects that makes no sense and then design a way to sell it as well as a website to showcase our work.

As the only developper on the team, my role was to translate our Figma model into a modern, single page application website including a 3D model as well as scroll animations.

You can explore the website at https://oncemade.netlify.app/
